# movie_site
In this project I have designed a site by using django to show different movies and their information. Every person can comment on the desired movie y typing it or by recording a voice. If the comment is not violent it will be shown on the site. I have used MBI api to change the voice to text and also for sentiment analysis of the comments. 
I have uploaded this site to python any where , you can visit this by clicking on : <a href="http://tahoora.pythonanywhere.com">site</a>
